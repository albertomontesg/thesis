\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis explore different approaches using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to classify and temporally localize activities on videos.

On it, it has been developed from scratch a neural network that tries to solve the activity classification and temporally location tasks in a simple and flexible way, extractig features from both video and audio track to train a Recurrent Neural Network.

Next it has been studied different kind of post processing to increase the previous proposed Neural Network.

Finally this network has been tested on a recent dataset of videos and submitted the results to the CVPR Challenge.
