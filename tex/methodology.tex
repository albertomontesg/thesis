\chapter{Methodology}

In this chapter it is going to be explained all the steps required to achieve a functional neural network to participate at the ActivityNet Challenge.

\section{ActivityNet Dataset}

How the dataset was downloaded.

Some stats about the dataset such as figures about the activity apperance.

\section{Extracting Video Features Using C3D}

First that the C3D weights were ported from Caffe to Theano

Then how the videos were read (OpenCV) and passed to the ported C3D model. Extracted the features of the fc6 layer.

\section{Extracting Audio Features}

The audio features extracted: MFCC and Spectral

\section{Prepare the Data for Stateful Recurrent Networks}

How the data was prepared to be trained to the Recurrent Network

\section{Networks Configuration}

Talk about the different configurations I have tried:
* Normal LSTM with different variations in number of layers and neurons
* Feedback Model
* Semisupervised

\section{Post-Processing Proposed}

How to compute the classification for each video.

How to get the temporal localization of the activities to the videos.
Mean filter, activity probability computation.
