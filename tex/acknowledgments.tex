\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all I would like to thank my two advisors of this project, Xavier Gir√≥-i-Nieto and Amaia Salvador for guiding and teaching me during all this project. I am aware that without their help I would have not been able to achieve this thesis.

I would also like to thank Santi Pascual and Professor Ignasi Esquerra for their help on topics they master: Recurrent Neural Networks and audio descriptors respectively. I should give also special thanks to Albert Gil for all the technical support provided along the development of this thesis.

Finally I would like to thank my family and the people closest to me for their encouragment, valuable support and patience during the development of my thesis.
