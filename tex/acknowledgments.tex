\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all I would like to thank my two tutors of this project, Xavier Gir√≥-i-Nieto and Amaia Salvador for guiding and teaching me during all this project. I am aware that without their help I would have not been able to achieve this thesis.

I would also like to thank Santi Pascual and Professor Ignasi Esquerra for their help on topics they master: Recurrent Neural Networks and audio descriptors respectively. A special thanks to Albert Gil for all the technical help required on the development of this thesis. 

Finally I would like to thank the people closest to me, for their valuable support and patience with me and my work.
