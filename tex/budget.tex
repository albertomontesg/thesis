This project has been developed using the resources provided by the Image Processing Group at UPC. For the development, computational resources and equipment was required such as a laptop to develop and a high performance GPUs to train the Neural Networks.

In addition, the main costs of this project comes from the salary of the researchers and the time spent on it. It will be considered that my position has been as Junior Engineer, while my two tutors of the project who where advising me have the salary of a Senior Engineer.
