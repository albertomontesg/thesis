\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\textcolor{red}{XAVI: Do not forget.}

To talk about on the conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bad audio at the video and that's why the audio does not improve
    \item The C3D network was pre-trained for the Sports1M dataset so that's why the best score were to the sports categories.
    \item Why the simplest architecture gives better results (only be a little) than the feedback architecture
    \item Same results that other participant on the Challenge but using a more simplest network.
    \item good results taking into account that it has been all done from scratch.
\end{itemize}


As future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use optical flow as input as used in paper \cite{simonyan2014two}\cite{Ng_2015_CVPR}\cite{yao2015describing}
    \item Extract features of Conv layers rather than the first fc layer
    \item Improve with this hierarchy of action/background + classification (inspired by \cite{shoutemporal})
    \item Pre-traine networks to predict the next frame
    \item Train on 3D volumes (tubelets) directly
    \item Thumos challenge? If not try working with Thumos dataset\cite{THUMOS15}
    \item keep going the research line on the Image Processing group

\end{itemize}
