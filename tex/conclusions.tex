\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

To talk about on the conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bad audio features
    \item The C3D network was pre-trained for the Sports1M dataset so that's why the best score were to the sports categories.
    \item Same results that other participant on the Challenge but using a more simplest network.
\end{itemize}


As future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use optical flow as input as used in paper \cite{simonyan2014two}\cite{Ng_2015_CVPR}\cite{Yao_2015_ICCV}
    \item Extract features of Conv layers rather than the first fc layer
    \item Improve with this hierarchy of action/background + classification (inspired by \cite{shoutemporal})
    \item Pre-traine networks to predict the next frame
    \item Train on 3D volumes (tubelets) directly
    \item Thumos challenge? If not try working with Thumos dataset\cite{THUMOS15}
\end{itemize}
